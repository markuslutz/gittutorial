ItÂ´s time to think about when those "creatures" came into
our lifes.....
35.000 years ago human-erectus and wolfe-alike dogs were 
forgeing a bond for life!

So this will now start the main dev about
Animals
in particular cats and dogs.

You must know cats and dogs are the very most
"treue freunde"  a human can think of.

All about my dog:-)


Another friend is Andrea:)

But from now on this is about 
my dog Tessi!
She likes snow very much.

But there are other dogs too and
her friend is called Kruemel.
